A simple tic-tac-toe game where each player is prompted to choose a location on the board
to place their respective markers. The program is capped at 9 turns, and the program will terminate
at the end of the 9 turns. To play, the player will be prompted to enter their desired location.
(separated by row number and column number) Their marker on that position will be displayed
on the board. Make sure to enter the correct location! The positions should not be out-of-bounds. (of the board)

To run the game, simply enter the commands:

g++ TicTacToe.cpp

./a.out
